It was a cold and dark winter night back in 30th November 2010 (according to the filestamps) and the central heating blew off.
The room temperature started to decline but we needed to continue working.
Hot coffee and tea where not able to keep us warm in any way, so we decided to transform electrical power into heat.

The obvious solution for a computer science guy was to use inefficient CPU cores.
Our first program was an endless loop just incrementing a single integer which could not saturate our multi-core processer in any way.
The room temperature wasn't high enough to let our fingers typing.

So let's start more threads!

In short: this program is about threads and computing absolute garbish.

Written in Java.
